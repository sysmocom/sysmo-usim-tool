This repository contains a python language utility to configure the
vendor-specific parameters of sysmocom programmable SIM/USIM/ISIM cards.

sysmoISIM-SJA2

The sysmoISIM-SJA2 is programmable and Java capable USIM, ISIM and HPSIM card.
Each card is using a separate ADM1 key and the default configuration is
hacker/developer friendly (fields being writable, reduced security for
installing applets to have more quick development cycles).
